### GitHub 101

#### Step 1 Fork Repo

Be logged into your own GitHub account and navigate to [https://github.com/csudsc/csudsc.github.io/](https://github.com/csudsc/csudsc.github.io/). Chances are you're already there so great job.

Then fork the repo using the fork button in the top right of this page.

You'll now have your own version of the repo on your account.

#### Step 2 Clone Repo

If you're unfamiliar with GitHub or Git you should probably get started using [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), which is a user friendly gui. So go download that if it's not already on your computer. Sign in to your GitHub account on GitHub Desktop. You'll now be able to clone the repository on to your machine.

You be able to see what changes you've made and make sure they look good. Then give a short description of your Pull Request. Say what you've change, and why you changed it.

Wait for someone to approve your pull request. You maybe asked to changed something before the request is accepted or it maybe denied. But with this project it's unlikely there will be any complaints.
