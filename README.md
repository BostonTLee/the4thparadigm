You'll now have your own version of the repo on your account.

##### Step 2 Clone Repo

If you're unfamiliar with GitHub or Git you should probably get started using [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), which is a user friendly gui. So go download that if it's not already on your computer. Sign in to your GitHub account on GitHub Desktop. You'll now be able to clone the repository on to your machine.

You be able to see what changes you've made and make sure they look good. Then give a short description of your Pull Request. Say what you've change, and why you changed it.

##### Step 6 Wait

Wait for someone to approve your pull request. You maybe asked to changed something before the request is accepted or it maybe denied. But with this project it's unlikely there will be any complaints.
